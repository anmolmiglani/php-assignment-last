INSTALL
=======

This is a short document to explain how to get the basic LAMPAS system
up and running.

Please keep in mind that LAMPAS is still in very early development.

Dependencies
------------

This document assumes you have Apache2 and mod_perl working. Please refer to:

	http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=31293&group_id=149566

Step 1
------

Untar the lampas-<version>.tar.gz in any directory

Step 2
------

Become root

Step 3
------

Change to the directory where you untarred the LAMPAS tar ball.

	# cd <dir>/lampas-<version>/
	
Step 4
------

Run the make process

	# make install
	
The base files will be installed in /opt/lampas

Your LAMPAS files are now installed. The rest of the configuration 
explains how existing system files need to be modified to get your local
web browser to see the LAMPAS sample site.

NOTE: The directory '/opt/lampas/mods/LAMPAS/' should for now already 
      contain the required modules pre-compiled.	

Step 5
------

Add the sample domain to the /etc/hosts file. Add the following line to 
/etc/hosts:

	<your IP addr>	www.lampas.tld
	
Step 6
------

You will now need to consult your distribution documentation to figure 
out how your Apache installation will import oter configuration files - 
in our case our LAMPAS VHOSTS files, living in:

	/opt/lampas/conf/vhosts/
	
If you did a custom build using advice from my documentation, you must open the
httpd.conf file and search for the line:

	# Virtual hosts
	#Include conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

And ADD the following line directly after the second comment line:

	Include /opt/lampas/conf/vhosts/*.conf
	
NOTE: you need to enable name based virtual hosts. On Mandriva, I needed
to add the following line to /etc/httpd/conf/vhosts/Vhosts.conf:

	# LAMPAS Configuration for name based virtual hosts
	NameVirtualHost *:80

Step 7
------

Next you need to set-up your DB. Import the file:

	src/lampas_20060726_2315.sql

The above file contains all the required SQL to create the `lampas` DB.

I tested on MySQL 4.1.

You may need to edit the file:

	conf/vhosts/lampas.conf

Please note that the MySQL DB config matches your set-up.

Step 8
------

Restart Apache.

Step 9
------

If you are using other computers on the LAN to maybe test to the sample
application, add the hosts entry (see step 5) to the relevant hosts file
of that Operating System.

Step 10
------

Test. point your web browser to http://www.lampas.tld
