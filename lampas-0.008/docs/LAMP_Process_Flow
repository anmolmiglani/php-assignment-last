Here is some notes regarding process flow within a LAMP (mod_perl) default handler (and possibly other handlers).

High Level:
----------

	Step 1 - Load config
	Step 2 - Authentication and Authorisation
	Step 3 - Handle request
	Step 4 - Clean-up
	Step 5 - Present/return result

Step 1 - Detailed
-----------------

The first config to load is the DB config. This should be parameters passed to the script ENV from the Apache config.

The loaddbconf() function will handle this part.

From here, the rest of the config is loaded into a hash: %lconfig which will contain all the script properties.

NOTE: When the pid for the application and path is NOT known (in other words, not passed as a parmater) use the default code for the path

Step 2 - Authentication and Authorisation
-----------------------------------------

Flags in table `package_permisssions`:

	Field type: varchar(32) where each position, starting from LEFT, has the following meaning:

	Pos 00	- Update of Package Source
	Pos 01	- Read package Src
	Pos 02	- Update package doc
	Pos 03	- Read package doc
	Pos 04	- Deploy package
	Pos 05	- Execute package (LAMPAS Client)
	pos 06 to Pos 31	- EMPTY (reserved)

	The default for a public domain resource would be: "00000100000000000000000000000000"

Each time a package is created, the maintaining group id (from the user logged in) will get the following permissions:

	"11110100000000000000000000000000"

And the LAMPAS super user will then grant deployment rights to various users or groups.
