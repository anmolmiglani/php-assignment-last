I have done a lot of experimenting the last couple of months and I know
I am guilty of not releasing early and often. The problem was that many
of the concepts and code changed on a major way, and I first wanted to
get to a state where things are pretty much figured out (in theory)
before building the 0.005 release.

Well, it is done. I have not yet managed to complete a "compiler" per
say, but the current code base should be enough tooo give you an idea
of where this project is heading.

In a nutshell then:

	* The LAMPAS system consists of:

		- An Apache vhost config file
		- A "package" (mod_perl module) that is run based on
		  the config from the vhost

	* Some database entries were created to facilitate for now the
	  basic program flow of the LAMPAS system.

What happens is that through the mod_perl configuration, the LAMPAS 
modules are pre-loaded (advantage of mod_perl), but some of the source
code exists in the database. When the vhost redirect a request to our
mod_perl handler, the code is loaded from thhhe database and executed.

This means that your source code version control and entire software
development life cycle (SDLC) now lives in a DB. In future, the LAMPAS
system will also facilitate:

	* Your DNS configuration (using BIND zone files)
	* Deploy your domains
	* Manage TCP and DNS load balancing
	* Advanced permission management
	* System monitoring

This is just the beginning. Since I now have a base from where to start
the next steps are to start to build the web management front end.

Look out for more developments soon. Since the base code is now done, I
am confident that future releases will be more frequent.

If you are interested in some of the details regarding the DB set-up, 
please read the following doc:

I am busy with the process flow document. The beginnings is available
in the file:
